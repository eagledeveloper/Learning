You have an immutable type code that affects the behavior of a class.

Replace the type code with subclasses.


Mechanics
• Self-encapsulate the type code.
If the type code is passed into the constructor, you need to replace the constructor with a factory method.
• For each value of the type code, create a subclass. Override the getting method of the type code in the subclass to return the relevant value.
• Remove the type code field from the superclass. Declare the accessors for the type code as abstract.
