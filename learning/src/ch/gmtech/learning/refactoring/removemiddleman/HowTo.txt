Motivation

A class is doing too much simple delegation.
Get the client to call the delegate directly.
The price is that every time the client wants to use a new feature of the delegate, you have to add a simple delegating method to the server.
A good encapsulation six months ago may be awkward now.


Mechanics

• Create an accessor for the delegate.
• For each client use of a delegate method, remove the method from the server and replace the call in the client to call method on the delegate.
