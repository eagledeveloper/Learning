Data item that needs additional data or behavior.

Early stages of development -->  representing simple facts as simple data items.
 
When the smell begins, turn the data value into an object.



Mechanics

• Create the class for the value. Give it a final field of the same type as the value in the source class. Add a getter and a constructor that takes the field as an argument.
• Change the type of the field in the source class to the new class.
• Change the getter in the source class to call the getter in the new class.
• If the field is mentioned in the source class constructor, assign the field using the constructor of the new class.
• Change the setting method to create a new instance of the new class.
• You may now need to use Change Value to Reference on the new object.
