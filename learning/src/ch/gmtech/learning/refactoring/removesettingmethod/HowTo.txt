Motivation

A field should be set at creation time and never altered. Remove any setting method for that field.
Providing a setting method indicates that a field may be changed. If you don't want that field to change once the object is created,
then don't provide a setting method (and make the field final). That way your intention is clear and you often remove the very
possibility that the field will change.


Mechanics

• Check that the setting method is called only in the constructor, or in a method called by the constructor.
• Modify the constructor to access the variables directly (you cannot do this if you have a subclass setting the private fields of a
superclass. In this case you should try to provide a protected superclass method (ideally a constructor) to set these values.
Whatever you do, don't give the superclass method a name that will confuse it with a setting method).
• Remove the setting method and make the field final.
