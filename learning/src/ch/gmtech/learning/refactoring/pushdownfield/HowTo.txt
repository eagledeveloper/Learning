Motivation

A field is used only by some subclasses. Move the field to those subclasses.
Push Down Field is the opposite of Pull Up Field. Use it when you don't need a field in the superclass but only in a subclass.


Mechanics

• Declare the field in all subclasses.
• Remove the field from the superclass.
• Remove the field from all subclasses that don't need it.
