Motivation

A client is calling a delegate class of an object.
Create methods on the server to hide the delegate.

Encapsulation means that objects need to know less about other parts of the system. 
You should hide your fields.
Extract Class


Mechanics

• For each method on the delegate, create a simple delegating method on the server.
• Adjust the client to call the server. (If the client is not in the same package as the server, consider
changing the delegate method's access to package visibility)
• If no client needs to access the delegate anymore, remove the server's accessor for the
delegate.
