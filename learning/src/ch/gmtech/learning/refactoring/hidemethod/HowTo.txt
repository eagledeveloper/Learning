Motivation

A method is not used by any other class. Make the method private.
Refactoring often causes you to change decisions about the visibility of methods.
Cases in which you need to make a method more visible: another class needs it and you thus relax the visibility.
A tool should check all methods to see whether they can be hidden or manually at regular intervals.
A case is most common when you are starting with a class that is little more than an encapsulated data holder. As more behavior is built
into the class, you may find that many of the getting and setting methods are no longer needed publicly, in which case they can be hidden. 


Mechanics

• Check regularly for opportunities to make a method more private (Use a lint-style tool, do manual checks every so often, and check when
you remove a call to a method in another class. Particularly look for cases such as this with setting methods).
• Make each method as private as you can.
