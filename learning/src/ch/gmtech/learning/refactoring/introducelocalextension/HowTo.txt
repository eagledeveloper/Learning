Motivation

A server class you are using needs several additional methods, but you can't modify the class.
Create a new class that contains these extra methods. Make this extension class a subclass or a wrapper of the original.
If you can modify the source, often the best thing is to add that method.
If you need one or two methods, you can use Introduce Foreign Method.
Separate class, but a subtype that supports all the things do but also adds the extra features.
Subclass is less work.
Original is immutable mean no problem.
The original can change, problem, changes in one object won't change the other and I have to use a wrapper.


Mechanics

• Create an extension class either as a subclass or a wrapper of the original.
• Add converting constructors to the extension (A constructor takes the original as an argument.
 The subclass version calls an appropriate superclass constructor; the wrapper version sets the delegate field to the argument).
• Add new features to the extension.
• Replace the original with the extension where needed.
• Move any foreign methods defined for this class onto the extension.
