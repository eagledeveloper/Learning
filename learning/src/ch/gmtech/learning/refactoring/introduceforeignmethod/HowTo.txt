Motivation

A server class you are using needs an additional method, but you can't modify the class.
Create a method in the client class with an instance of the server class as its first argument.
There is one service it doesn't give you but should.
If you can change the source, you can add in the method.
If you can't change the source, you have to code around the lack of the method in the client.
Creating many foreign methods on a server class, or many of your classes need the same foreign method, you should use Introduce Local Extension instead.
Foreign methods are a work-around.

Mechanics

• Create a method in the client class that does what you need (The method should not access any of the features of the client class. If it needs a value, send it in as a parameter).
• Make an instance of the server class the first parameter.
• Comment the method as "foreign method; should be in server (this way you can use a text search to find foreign methods later if you get the chance to move the method).
