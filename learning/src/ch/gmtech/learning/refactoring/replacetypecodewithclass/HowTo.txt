A class has a numeric type code that does not affect its behavior.

Replace the type code with a class only if the type code is pure data




Mechanics

• Create a new class for the type code.
• Modify the implementation of the source class to use the new class.
• For each method on the source class that uses the code, create a new method that uses the new class instead.
• One by one, change the clients of the source class so that they use the new interface.
• Remove the old interface that uses the codes, and remove the static declarations of the codes
