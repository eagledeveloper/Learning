Motivation

A section of code assumes something about the state of the program. Make the assumption explicit with an assertion.
Often sections of code work only if certain conditions are true.
An assertion is a conditional statement that is assumed to be always true.
Assertion failures should always result in unchecked exceptions.
Assertions should never be used by other parts of the system. Indeed assertions usually are removed for production code.
It is therefore important to signal something is an assertion.
Assertions act as communication and debugging aids.
Debugging help is less important when I write self-testing code


Mechanics

Use assertions only to check things that need to be true.
If the code works without the assertion, the assertion is confusing rather than helpful.
Beware of duplicate code in assertions. Duplicate code smells just as bad in assertion checks as it does anywhere else.
Use Extract Method liberally to get rid of the duplication.
